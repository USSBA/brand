# Photography

Photography can be used to really grab people's attention, so we recommend you use it strategically and for the most important pieces of content. Photography can help humanize print and web collateral, invoking emotional responses from the viewers and making the SBA seem more relatable. 

The following guidelines are best practices for choosing high quality and engaging photos:

<ul>
<li>Photos need to be environmental, not studio shots or isolated imagery against a white background.</li>

<li>Photos should include people when possible. Models should look natural and not too posed. They should be in action, but not overacting.</li> 

<li>Try to choose photos that represent a diversity of people, not just young and good-looking people.</li>

<li>Scenes need to be well lit with bright, natural light. The image should be clear, not shot through glass, or with lens flares, or with photo overlays.</li>
</ul>
