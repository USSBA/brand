# Illustrations and iconography

Illustrations and iconography are great tools to visually represent complex ideas. However, they require some thought and strategy when using them. Illustrations should not be used solely for decoration.

Our illustration and iconography style is clean, modern, playful but still professional, and a touch dynamic. It should work well on a white or very light gray background.

SBA staff and contractors can download [illustrations and icons](https://sba123.sharepoint.com/offices/OMCS/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Foffices%2FOMCS%2FDocuments%2FBrand%20Icons&FolderCTID=0x012000BBD3D74ACCE4C342A5321E8615767791&View=%7B48C5815D-F2B3-42B3-B504-7D837B3B5ED8%7D) that SBA developed and approved.


## Aesthetic guidelines

### Perspective
Illustrations and icons should be portrayed from one perspective, either the front or the top, giving it a flat appearance.

## Tints of Secondary Colors in Illustration and Iconography

Tints of secondary colors are permitted only in illustrations and iconography on SBA.gov to add depth and dimension. Color palette combinations should be used sparingly and must be color contrast accessible. Primary colors should be predominant.

Tints:
Hex	#a5c6e0
Hex	#a8c4b1
Hex	#fbedb2
Hex	#c5c4c4
