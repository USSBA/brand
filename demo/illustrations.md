# Illustrations and iconography

Illustrations and iconography are great tools to visually represent complex ideas thereby making them more accessible. They should not be used as just decoration and require some thought and strategy when using them.

Our illustration and iconography style is clean, modern, playful but still professional, and a touch dynamic. They should work well on a white or very light gray background.


## Guidelines for illustration and iconography aesthetics

### Perspective
Illustrations and icons should be portrayed from one perspective, either the front or the top, giving it a flat appearance.
