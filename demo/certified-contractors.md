# SBA-certified contractors

Let others know about your participation in SBA certification and business development programs for federal contractors.



## Digital icons

Small businesses participating in SBA federal contracting certification and business development programs may use SBA-approved <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sba/resource-partners/decals-and-icons.zip">digital icons (.zip)</a> to indicate their certification status. Active participants in the following programs are eligible to use the icons:

<ul>
<li>8(a) Business Development program</li>
<li>Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs)</li>
<li>Economically Disadvantaged WOSBs</li>
<li>HUBZone</li>

</ul>

The icons may be used on business websites, business cards, and social media profiles, as well as on capability statements and proposal bids.

However, digital icons <strong>may not</strong> be used to express or imply endorsement of any goods, services, entities, or individuals. Therefore, they <strong>may not</strong> be used on company letterhead, marketing materials, or advertising—paid ads as well as public service announcements—in either digital or traditional media formats.

If your business is no longer certified or participating in one of SBA’s federal contracting or business development programs, you must discontinue using SBA icons.

Contact your assigned <a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance">SBA District Office</a> with any questions you may have.
