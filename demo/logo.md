# Logo

<div class="usa-grid-full">  
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p>Our new logo is modern, strong, and meaningful. It reflects our mission and our value as a catalyst for the growth of small businesses, as well as the nation’s economy. Design elements convey SBA’s strength, innovative thinking, and commitment to connecting our customers with the resources and support they need to get started, grow and expand, or recover. It symbolizes what makes the SBA uniquely able to empower small businesses and power the American dream.</p>

## Logo use

The SBA logo and mark are for official governmental use and any alteration, distortion, re-creation, or misuse is prohibited. The logo and mark can only be used by SBA employees in their official duties, for publicizing and identifying the SBA, its programs and activities on official outreach materials and publications.

<strong> Resource Partners </strong><br/>
SBA Resource Partners cannot use the logo except as authorized by the Agency in connection with a cosponsorship agreement.

<strong>Outside party</strong><br/>
When the SBA’s logo is used by an outside party, the Agency’s role in the activity and its relationship to that outside party must be clear. For example, include the phrase “Funds Guaranteed by the SBA” when a business posts a sign announcing an expansion or new location. Use of the Agency’s logo cannot imply an endorsement or preferential treatment, or suggest a relationship that does not exist. When uncertain as to the appropriate use of the Agency’s logo, contact OMCS for guidance by emailing marketinghq@sba.gov.

<strong>Contractors</strong><br/>
SBA contractors or grantees should use the logo only in the manner prescribed in their cooperative agreement or contract.

<strong>Cobranding</strong><br/>
Cobranded publications should display the SBA logo in the primary position, which is in the upper left of the page or cover, above other logos. When grouped with other logos, the SBA logo should be in the first position on the left. It should be comparable in size to any other logos on the page. Only logos of entities participating in the cosponsored activity, those appearing in the original cosponsorship agreement or subsequently joindered into the agreement, may cobrand with the SBA.

Non-program cosponsored materials should incorporate the SBA identity as prominent, and dominate lower left position is preferred.

## Lockups

### Stacked
<div class="usa-grid-full">  
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p>
      The stacked lockup is the primary option and should be used at all times unless vertical space is limited.
    </p>

</div>
### Horizontal
<div class="usa-grid-full">  
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p>
      The horizontal lockup is the secondary option and appears on our website and in limited vertical space.

  <div class="usa-width-one-third">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sba/img/pages/logo/lockups-horizontal.svg" alt="Logo SBA" /> 
  </div>
</div>
### Isolated
<div class="usa-grid-full">  
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p>
      The isolated logo mark is primarily used for creating texture and bold graphic elements. This may include patterns on a step and repeat, scarves, ties, and isolated usage on hats. In most instances, the logo needs to be in a lockup with “U.S. Small Business Administration” to ensure clear communication.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sba/img/pages/logo/lockups-isolated.svg" alt="Logo SBA" /> 
  </div>
</div>
### Minimum Size
<div class="usa-grid-full">  
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p>
The small execution lockup is used when the logo needs to scale down. The small execution logo allows “U.S. Small Business Administration” to remain legible. The minimum width allowed for the entire lockup
of the horizontal logo is 136px at 72dpi.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<ul class="usa-accordion">
  <li>
    <button class="usa-accordion-button"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="a1">
      What are the general rules regarding the use of SBA’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion-content">
      The Agency’s logo may only be used to promote SBA and/or its programs, activities, and services. SBA’s logo cannot be used in a way that suggests the Agency is endorsing any individual, organization, product, or service or in a way which implies that an improper relationship exists between SBA and an outside party. SBA’s logo also must not be used in any manner that is liable to bring the Agency into a negative light. For example, SBA’s logo may not appear in connection with any products or services related to the alcohol, gambling, or adult entertainment industries, any lobbying efforts, or any political activities.

      aria-controls="a2">
      For what purposes may SBA employees use the Agency’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a2" class="usa-accordion-content">
      SBA employees may use the Agency’s logo for publicizing, branding, and identifying SBA and its programs and activities on official business cards, presentations, reports, correspondence, signs marketing and outreach materials, and similar publications.

    <button class="usa-accordion-button"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="a3">
      May SBA’s logo be altered in any way other than size?
    </button>
    <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion-content">
        No, only OMCS staff has the authority to modify the Agency’s logo. No other employee or outside party may alter the color, proportions, or content of SBA’s logo. The Inspector General may promulgate a logo for the Inspector General’s Office. Aside from that, no employee outside of OMCS has the authority to create new SBA logos related to particular programs, offices, or initiatives. Furthermore, SBA’s logo may not be merged, combined, or cobranded (i.e., the logos are touching) with the logos of any other parties.

    <button class="usa-accordion-button"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="a4">
      May SBA use funds to put its logo on personal or promotional items?
    </button>
    <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <strong>Using appropriated funds.</strong> In general, SBA is restricted from using its appropriated funds to purchase promotional items or items of a personal nature, such as clothing (e.g., caps, jackets, and shirts). Such purchases are permissible only where the item directly and primarily serves the purpose of conveying information to the public or the apparel serves to identify particular individuals as employees or acting in an official capacity. For example, Office of Disaster Assistance personnel providing services in an affected area may wear jackets or t-shirts with the SBA logo on them. Questions regarding use of appropriated funds to purchase SBA-branded apparel should be directed to the Office of General Counsel (202-205-6642) before the purchase is made.<br /><br />
<strong>Using gift funds.</strong> SBA may use gift funds to purchase promotional items or items of a personal nature in accordance with the rules set forth in the Gift SOP, SOP 90 53, and in particular Chapter two, paragraphs five through seven.

      aria-controls="a5">
      May outside organizations or individuals use SBA’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a5" class="usa-accordion-content">
       SBA’s logo is a protected mark under the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq.) and therefore it may only be used by outside organizations or individuals who obtain advance written permission from SBA. Outside parties operating under written agreements with SBA (such as other Federal agencies, grant recipients, contractors, Cosponsors, SAM participants, etc.) may use the Agency’s logo as authorized and specified in that underlying agreement. If there is no written agreement in place between SBA and an outside organization or individual, or if the agreement does not cover use of SBA’s logo, then the party wishing to use SBA’s logo must submit a written request for permission to either OMCS (for national entities) or, for local entities, to the relevant Responsible Program Official.<br /><br />
Responsible Program Officials will be held accountable for authorizing any use of the logo that is not in compliance with this SOP. When SBA’s logo is used by an outside party, that usage must make clear SBA’s role in the activity and its relationship to that outside party (for example, by featuring the phrase “Funds Guaranteed by” immediately preceding SBA’s logo, etc.). Use of the Agency’s logo must not imply an endorsement or preferential treatment or suggest a relationship which does not exist. Where a Responsible Program Official is uncertain as to whether use of the Agency’s logo is appropriate in a given situation, she or he should contact OMCS for additional guidance and support. For specific examples of circumstances when and how SBA’s logo may be used by outside parties (such as ads or other marketing materials, oversized ceremonial checks, etc.), please see the OMCS web site.<br /><br />
This policy on the use of SBA’s logo does not supersede the legal principles of fair use of trademarks. Thus, SBA’s logo may be used by outside organizations for news reporting and other critiques without SBA’s prior permission, provided the logo use does not imply an endorsement or sponsorship by SBA.

      May participants in SBA programs display the Agency’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a6" class="usa-accordion-content">
      In order to highlight SBA’s contribution to the nation’s small businesses, SBA may from time to time make decals, or web icons, in window cling or electronic format, available to organizations or individuals who wish to display them. SBA may, at its sole discretion, prohibit any individual or business from displaying SBA’s logo if SBA determines that allowing that individual or business to display the logo would not be in the best interest of the Agency, and may issue such other guidelines or restrictions on the display of the logo as it determines prudent.<br /><br />
Decals or web icons that identify participation in an SBA program may only be used for the purpose of identifying or acknowledging an organization or individual’s participation in a specific Agency program, and the individual or organization must cease its use after termination, graduation, completion or withdrawal from the program. Window decals and web icons may not be used in a way that suggests the Agency has endorsed or conferred a seal of approval upon any entity, product, or service, nor may they be used for purposes of advertisement. Participants and third parties may not alter the logos they receive from SBA in any way.<br /><br />
District office personnel may distribute SBA window decals to qualifying parties. For available decals, see the OMCS YES page.

    <div id="a7" class="usa-accordion-content">
      There is one SBA lender web icon provided by the Agency for use by lenders approved by the SBA to offer SBA loan products under SBA’s [Preferred Lender/Express; Lender/Certified; or Lender/Microloan] programs. Used in this context, participating lenders are those lenders who are in good standing with the Agency, have signed SBA Form 750 and are authorized to offer their respective programs.<br /><br />The SBA Lender Web Icon and usage guidelines can be found <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support--advertising-your-sba-relationship">here</a>.

      Can SBA’s logo be used for a third-party activity?
    </button>
    <div id="a8" class="usa-accordion-content">
      Where the conditions discussed in the paragraphs below are met, SBA’s logo may appear in connection with third-party activities. As a general rule, if SBA is participating in a limited capacity in an event hosted by one or more other entities, then the Agency’s logo may appear in materials promoting that event only if those materials have separate, clearly marked sections distinguishing participants from hosts or sponsors of the event, or if the Agency’s logo only appears directly above or beside the SBA representative’s name or bio.<br/><br/>
Additionally, while an SBA employee is making a presentation at a third-party activity, the Agency’s logo may be displayed on a sign or electronic media near the presenter only for the course of that presentation. Once the SBA employee finishes the presentation, the Agency’s logo must be removed from display.

      What should RPOs consider in determining whether to authorize logo use by a third party?
    </button>
    <div id="a9" class="usa-accordion-content">
      When SBA’s logo is used by an outside party, that usage must make clear SBA’s role in the activity and its relationship to that outside party (for example, by featuring the phrase “Funds Guaranteed by” immediately preceding SBA’s logo, etc.). Use of the Agency’s logo must not imply an endorsement or preferential treatment or suggest a relationship which does not exist.<br/><br/>
The RPO must decide whether a proposed use of the SBA logo is appropriate. The RPO should consider whether the entity using the logo is commercial or noncommercial, whether the logo use implies an association between SBA with a product and service, whether the logo is accompanied by the disclaimer in section 4, and other factors appropriate to the situation.<br/><br/>
Where an RPO is uncertain as to whether use of the Agency’s logo is appropriate in connection with a particular third-party activity, she or he should contact district counsel or the Office of Marketing and Customer Service (OMCS) for additional guidance and support. The RPO is accountable for inappropriate use of the logo in third-party events.
