      May SBA’s logo be altered in any way other than size?
    </button>
    <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion-content">
      No, only OMCS staff has the authority to modify the Agency’s logo. No other employee or
      outside party may alter the color, proportions, or content of SBA’s logo. The Inspector General
      may promulgate a logo for the Inspector General’s Office. Aside from that, no employee outside
      of OMCS has the authority to create new SBA logos related to particular programs, offices, or
      initiatives. Furthermore, SBA’s logo may not be merged, combined, or cobranded (i.e., the logos
      are touching) with the logos of any other parties.

      What are the general rules regarding the use of SBA’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a2" class="usa-accordion-content">
      The Agency’s logo may only be used to promote SBA and/or its programs, activities, and
      services. SBA’s logo cannot be used in a way that suggests the Agency is endorsing any
      individual, organization, product, or service or in a way which implies that an improper
      relationship exists between SBA and an outside party. SBA’s logo also must not be used in
      any manner that is liable to bring the Agency into a negative light. For example, SBA’s logo may
      not appear in connection with any products or services related to the alcohol, gambling, or adult
      entertainment industries, any lobbying efforts, or any political activities.

      May SBA use funds to put its logo on personal or promotional items?
    </button>
    <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <strong>Using appropriated funds.</strong> In general, SBA is restricted from using its appropriated funds to
      purchase promotional items or items of a personal nature, such as clothing (e.g., caps, jackets,
      and shirts). Such purchases are permissible only where the item directly and primarily serves
      the purpose of conveying information to the public or the apparel serves to identify particular
      individuals as employees or acting in an official capacity. For example, Office of Disaster
      Assistance personnel providing services in an affected area may wear jackets or t-shirts with the
      SBA logo on them. Questions regarding use of appropriated funds to purchase SBA-branded
      apparel should be directed to the Office of General Counsel (202-205-6642) before the purchase
      is made.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Using gift funds.</strong> SBA may use gift funds to purchase promotional items or items of a personal
      nature in accordance with the rules set forth in the Gift SOP, SOP 90 53, and in particular
      Chapter two, paragraphs five through seven.

      aria-controls="a5">
      May outside organizations or individuals use SBA’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a5" class="usa-accordion-content">
      SBA’s logo is a protected mark under the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq.) and therefore it may only be used by outside organizations or individuals who obtain advance written permission from SBA. Outside parties operating under written agreements with SBA (such as other Federal agencies, grant recipients, contractors, Cosponsors, SAM participants, etc.) may use the Agency’s logo as authorized and specified in that underlying agreement. If there is no written agreement in place between SBA and an outside organization or individual, or if the agreement does not cover use of SBA’s logo, then the party wishing to use SBA’s logo must submit a written request for permission to either OMCS (for national entities) or,for local
      entities, to the relevant Responsible Program Official.<br/><br/>

      Responsible Program Officials will be held accountable for authorizing any use of the logo that is not in compliance with this SOP. When SBA’s logo is used by an outside party, that usage must make clear SBA’s role in the activity and its relationship to that outside party (for example, by featuring the phrase “Funds Guaranteed by” immediately preceding SBA’s logo, etc.). Use of the Agency’s logo must not imply an endorsement or preferential treatment or suggest a relationship which does not exist. Where a Responsible Program Official is uncertain as to whether use of the Agency’s logo is appropriate in a given situation, she or he should contact OMCS for additional guidance and support. For specific examples of circumstances when and
      how SBA’s logo may be used by outside parties (such as ads or other marketing materials, oversized ceremonial checks, etc.), please see the OMCS web site. <br/><br/>
      
      This policy on the use of SBA’s logo does not supersede the legal principles of fair use of trademarks. Thus, SBA’s logo may be used by outside organizations for news reporting and other critiques without SBA’s prior permission, provided the logo use does not imply an endorsement or sponsorship by SBA.

      aria-controls="a6">
      May participants in SBA programs display the Agency’s logo?
    </button>
    <div id="a6" class="usa-accordion-content">
      In order to highlight SBA’s contribution to the nation’s small businesses, SBA may from time to time make decals, or web icons, in window cling or electronic format, available to organizations or individuals who wish to display them. SBA may, at its sole discretion, prohibit any individual or business from displaying SBA’s logo if SBA determines that allowing that individual or business to display the logo would not be in the best interest of the Agency, and may issue such other guidelines or restrictions on the display of the logo as it determines prudent.<br/><br/>
      
      Decals or web icons that identify participation in an SBA program may only be used for the purpose of identifying or acknowledging an organization or individual’s participation in a specific Agency program, and the individual or organization must cease its use after termination, graduation, completion or withdrawal from the program. Window decals and web icons may not be used in a way that suggests the Agency has endorsed or conferred a
      seal of approval upon any entity, product, or service, nor may they be used for purposes of advertisement. Participants and third parties may not alter the logos they receive from SBA in any way.<br/><br/>
      
      District office personnel may distribute SBA window decals to qualifying parties. For available decals, see the OMCS YES page.

      Can SBA’s logo be used for a third-party activity?
    </button>
    <div id="a7" class="usa-accordion-content">
      Where the conditions discussed in the paragraphs below are met, SBA’s logo may appear in
      connection with third-party activities. As a general rule, if SBA is participating in a limited
      capacity in an event hosted by one or more other entities, then the Agency’s logo may appear
      in materials promoting that event only if those materials have separate, clearly marked sections
      distinguishing participants from hosts or sponsors of the event, or if the Agency’s logo only
      appears directly above or beside the SBA representative’s name or bio.er guidelines or restrictions on the display of the logo as it determines prudent.<br/><br/>
      
      Additionally, while an SBA employee is making a presentation at a third-party activity, the
      Agency’s logo may be displayed on a sign or electronic media near the presenter only for the
      course of that presentation. Once the SBA employee finishes the presentation, the Agency’s logo
      must be removed from display.<br/><br/>

      Must a disclaimer be used in connection with SBA’s logo
    </button>
    <div id="a8" class="usa-accordion-content">
      Except where doing so is impractical due to space constraints, Responsible Program Officials
      are strongly encouraged to require use of the following disclaimer whenever SBA’s logo appears
      on materials produced by outside parties:<br/>
      
      <strong>SBA’s participation or support is not an endorsement of any product, service, or entity.</strong>
      When used, this disclaimer must appear in clearly legible type in close proximity to the Agency’s
      logo. For more information, see the disclaimer section.<br/><br/>
